    "desc": "As the main advantages of Vitaly, I would like to note his technical background, a high level of responsibility for the task assigned, and his ability to see things through to the end. On the last project (<Petly>), he proved himself worthy as a Scrum Master: he carefully approached the formation of a work plan, held productive daily meetings, and skillfully distributed tasks in unforeseen situations. His positive mood, and friendly attitude towards team members, among other things, contributed to the success of our team projects."

Under harsh conditions (war in the country), he managed to lead the team to the successful realization of the final project in the role of Scrum master."
